## Whats my Story?

Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. I moved by myself to the US in 2015 for highschool ~ was blessed with the opportunity to possible make more out of my life.

Went to Georgia State University where I studied Computer Information Systems with a minor in Finance.

Started / Co-founded a bunch of companies for a bunch of different reasons, some really good, some really bad...

Co-developed some pretty cool games (2) on the Roblox platform in the last year, with over 10M+ visits between them and a successful sale of one (100k+) in July 2024 ( and hopefully the second one as well early 2025 :) )

Made a lot of money in crypo.......also lost a lot of money in crypto ðŸ¤§
